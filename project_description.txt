Project Description:
NASCON (National Student Convention) is an annual event that brings together students from
various universities to participate in different competitions, workshops, and networking sessions.
The event also includes sponsorship deals, accommodation facilities, venue management, and
guest speaker sessions. Managing this large-scale event manually is challenging, so the goal of this
project is to develop a Database Management System that automates and streamlines all
processes related to event management.
Project Scope & Functional Modules
The system will be divided into several interconnected modules:
1. User Management System
 Users will have different roles:
o Admin: Manages the entire system
o Event Organizers: Handle events, venues, sponsorships, accommodations

o Sponsors: Provide funding and get branding opportunities
o Judges: Evaluate competitions and assign scores
 Role-based access using DCL (GRANT & REVOKE privileges)
2. Event Management & Venue Scheduling
 Organizers can create and manage different categories of events:
o Tech Events (Coding, Hackathons, AI Challenges)
o Business Competitions (Case Studies, Entrepreneurship Challenges)
o Gaming Tournaments (E-Sports, Console Gaming)
o General Events (Debates, Photography, Quiz Competitions)
 Venue Management
o Create a database of available venues (auditoriums, halls, labs, outdoor spaces)
